# UIUC CS Proficiency Exam Notes

Collection of my notes for UIUC CS proficiency exams for classes CS 124, CS 128, CS 173, CS 225, and STAT 107. My foundation before preparing for these exams was knowledge from AP Computer Science A and some minor knowledge of data structures and C++. My notes build on this foundational level of understanding.
